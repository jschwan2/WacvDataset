  We introduce I-MOVE, a new public RGB-D dataset for estimating the velocity of a moving object. The dataset features various outdoor and indoor scenes of single moving objects where the position and velocity for the object is supplied. Compared to other datasets, a unique property is that the ground truth velocity for each of the moving objects has been calculated and included for a variety of different settings / environments and objects. The dataset includes training and test images that were captured from six different RGB-D camera views, the data is also time synchronized with additional equipment (radar, motion capture, etc.) to verify calculated velocity and position ground truth. There are approximately 600K training and 100K test images from each scene for each of the six RGB-D cameras. The I-MOVE dataset is available online at ???.com.
